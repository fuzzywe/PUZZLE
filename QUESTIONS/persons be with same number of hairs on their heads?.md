Puzzle | Can 2 persons be with same number of hairs on their heads?
Last Updated : 18 Jan, 2023
One day Ram and Shyam were searching Google for finding what is the maximum number of hairs on the human head. They found that it is 2, 00, 000. Then Shyam thought a while and suddenly made a statement that there are at least two Bengaluru citizens who have got the exact same number of hairs on their heads. Both of them knew the fact that the population of Bengaluru is 1.23 crores.
But Ram was still thinking whether Shyam’s statement is correct or not.
Is Shyam’s statement 100% correct or we need more information to deduce the truth of the statement?

Yes, Shyam’s statement is **100% correct**, and here’s why:

### Explanation
This is an example of the **pigeonhole principle**, which states that if you have more "items" (people, in this case) than "containers" (possible hair counts), at least one container must contain more than one item. 

Here’s how it applies:

1. **Maximum Number of Hairs**: They found that the maximum number of hairs on a human head is **200,000**.
2. **Possible Hair Counts**: This means there are only **200,001 possible values** for the number of hairs on any person’s head (from 0 hairs up to 200,000 hairs).
3. **Population of Bengaluru**: The population of Bengaluru is **1.23 crores** (12.3 million people).

Since **12.3 million** is far greater than **200,001**, there must be **multiple people with the same number of hairs** on their heads. 

### Conclusion
With **12.3 million people** and only **200,001 possible hair counts**, it's mathematically certain (by the pigeonhole principle) that at least two people will have the **exact same number of hairs** on their heads. 

No additional information is needed to confirm Shyam’s statement—it’s logically guaranteed.
