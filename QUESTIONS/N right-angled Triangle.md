Let’s break it down step by step more clearly, so it’s easier to understand how a rectangle can be divided into **right-angled triangles** for values of \( n > 1 \).

---

### Step 1: Dividing a Rectangle into Two Right-Angled Triangles
A rectangle is a shape with **four 90-degree corners**.  
- If you draw a line from **one corner** of the rectangle to the **opposite corner**, this line is called the **diagonal**.  
- This diagonal divides the rectangle into **two identical right-angled triangles**.

So, **n = 2** is possible by drawing one diagonal of the rectangle.

---

### Step 2: Dividing a Rectangle into Four Right-Angled Triangles
To divide the rectangle into **four right-angled triangles**, you can draw **both diagonals** of the rectangle.  
- Now you have **4 right-angled triangles**, with each triangle sharing a corner of the rectangle.

So, **n = 4** is possible by drawing two diagonals.

---

### Step 3: Is It Possible to Divide a Rectangle into an Odd Number of Right-Angled Triangles?
No! The reason is:
- Every time you divide a rectangle using lines (diagonals or other segments), **each new line splits a region into exactly two new regions**.
- Since each split adds **two triangles**, the total number of triangles is always **even**.
  
Thus, **n must always be an even number**. You cannot get an odd number of right-angled triangles when dividing a rectangle.

---

### Final Answer
The only values of \( n \) where a rectangle can be divided into \( n \) right-angled triangles are:
\[
n = 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots
\]
or any **even number greater than 1**. There are no possible divisions for **odd numbers** of right-angled triangles.
