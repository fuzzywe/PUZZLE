No worries! Let’s break it down more simply:

### The Puzzle
1. **What You See**: The interviewer drew a **rectangle with two circles below it**. The rectangle is the bus, and the two circles are the wheels.

2. **The Question**: They asked you which direction the bus is going: **left or right?**

3. **The Trick to Solve It**: Think about a real bus. The bus has doors on only one side, usually to let people in and out.

### How to Figure It Out
1. **Imagine the Bus Door**:
   - If you **can see the door** on the side of the bus, then the bus is facing **left**.
   - If you **can’t see the door** (because it’s on the other side), then the bus is facing **right**.

### Why?
- In most countries, the bus door is on the right side of the bus.
- So, if the bus is moving **left**, you would see the door on the side facing you.
- If the bus is moving **right**, the door would be on the opposite side (and you wouldn’t see it).

### Answer:
- **If you don’t see a door** on the rectangle, the bus is moving **right**.
- **If you see a door**, the bus is moving **left**.

This is a visual clue puzzle: it’s about whether the door is visible or not, helping you guess which way the bus is moving.
