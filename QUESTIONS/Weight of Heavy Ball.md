Let’s walk through an example to illustrate each step.

Imagine you have **8 balls** labeled as **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H**, where one of them is heavier than the others. Let’s find out which one is heavier using the minimum number of weighings.

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **First Weighing**: Divide the 8 balls into **three groups**:
   - Group 1: **A, B, C**
   - Group 2: **D, E, F**
   - Group 3: **G, H**

   Weigh **Group 1 (A, B, C)** against **Group 2 (D, E, F)**.

   **Possible Outcomes**:

   - **Outcome 1**: The two groups (A, B, C) and (D, E, F) **balance**.  
     This means that none of the balls in these two groups is heavier, so the heavier ball must be in **Group 3 (G, H)**.

   - **Outcome 2**: One group is **heavier** than the other.  
     Suppose **(A, B, C) is heavier** than (D, E, F). This means the heavier ball is among **A, B, or C**.

### If Outcome 1 Occurs (Groups A, B, C and D, E, F balance)

2. Now we know the heavier ball is in **Group 3 (G, H)**.  
   - **Second Weighing**: Weigh **G** against **H**.

     - If **G** and **H** balance, all the balls would be identical, but since we know one is heavier, this means one of them must weigh more.  
     - If **G** is heavier than **H** (or vice versa), you have found the heavier ball.

**Conclusion**: You found the heavier ball in just **2 weighings**.


### If Outcome 2 Occurs (Group A, B, C is heavier than D, E, F)

3. Now we know the heavier ball is among **A, B, or C**.

   - **Second Weighing**: Weigh **A** against **B**.

     - If **A** and **B** balance, the heavier ball must be **C**.
     - If **A** is heavier than **B** (or vice versa), then **A** (or **B**) is the heavier ball.

**Conclusion**: You identified the heavier ball with **2 weighings** in both scenarios. 

This process allows you to efficiently determine which of the 8 balls is the heaviest using the fewest possible weighings.
