Puzzle 9 | (Find the fastest 3 horses)
Last Updated : 25 May, 2023
There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. You can conduct a race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point, you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out the minimum no. of races which are required to get the top 3 horses.

Certainly! Let's break down the process into a series of steps with a visual approach to make it easier to understand.

### Step 1: Initial Group Races (5 Races)

1. **Divide the 25 horses into 5 groups of 5 horses each**:
   - Group A: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5
   - Group B: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5
   - Group C: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5
   - Group D: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5
   - Group E: E1, E2, E3, E4, E5

2. **Race each group separately to find the relative ranking within each group**:
   - Race 1 (Group A): A1 > A2 > A3 > A4 > A5
   - Race 2 (Group B): B1 > B2 > B3 > B4 > B5
   - Race 3 (Group C): C1 > C2 > C3 > C4 > C5
   - Race 4 (Group D): D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 > D5
   - Race 5 (Group E): E1 > E2 > E3 > E4 > E5

   Now we have the fastest horse from each group:
   - **A1**, **B1**, **C1**, **D1**, and **E1**.

### Step 2: Winnersâ€™ Race (1 Race)

3. **Race the winners of each group to determine their relative speed**:
   - Race 6 (Winners): A1 > B1 > C1 > D1 > E1

   After this race, we know:
   - **A1** is the fastest horse overall.
   - **B1** and **C1** are possible candidates for the 2nd and 3rd fastest.
   - We can eliminate **D1** and **E1** from being in the top 3, as they are slower than A1, B1, and C1.

---

### Step 3: Identifying Final Candidates for 2nd and 3rd Place

4. Since A1 is the fastest, the next two fastest horses can only be among these:
   - **B1** and **C1** (ranked 2nd and 3rd in the winners' race).
   - **A2** and **A3** (the 2nd and 3rd horses in Group A, as they were only beaten by A1).
   - **B2** (the 2nd horse in Group B, as it was only beaten by B1).

   Thus, we have 5 candidates left: **B1, C1, A2, A3, and B2**.

---

### Step 4: Final Race Among Top Candidates (1 Race)

5. **Race these 5 horses to determine the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses**:
   - Race 7 (Final Race): The race result will give us the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses.

---

### Summary of Races

- **Races 1-5**: Group races to determine the fastest horse in each group.
- **Race 6**: Winners' race to determine the overall fastest and narrow down the candidates for 2nd and 3rd.
- **Race 7**: Final race among the top candidates to determine the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses.

### Visualization Summary

| Step               | Horses Involved                           | Outcome                                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Races 1-5**     | A1-A5, B1-B5, C1-C5, D1-D5, E1-E5        | Top horse from each group (A1, B1, C1, D1, E1)   |
| **Race 6**        | A1, B1, C1, D1, E1                       | Fastest horse (A1) and candidates for 2nd, 3rd   |
| **Race 7**        | B1, C1, A2, A3, B2                       | Determine 2nd and 3rd fastest horses             |

**Total Races = 7**

This approach efficiently narrows down the fastest three horses with the minimum number of races needed.
