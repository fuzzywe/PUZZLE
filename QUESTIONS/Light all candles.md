 

Consider a circle with 2014 candles, and only 2 of them are ignited, and the rest are not ignited. Anyone can choose any of the candles and change the state of the neighbouring candles (ignited to not-ignited or not-ignited to ignited). The task is to light all the 2014 candles?
Let me simplify the explanation step-by-step with clear logic. We’ll walk through the problem and why it’s impossible to light all 2014 candles using the given moves.

### Problem Restated
- There are **2014 candles** in a circle.
- Only **2 candles** are lit at the beginning, and the rest are unlit.
- You can pick **any candle**, and it will toggle the state (on/off) of **its two neighboring candles**.
- The goal is to determine if you can light **all 2014 candles** using this operation.

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. The Toggle Operation
When you choose a candle:
- **Only the neighboring two candles change their states**.
- If a neighbor is **on**, it becomes **off**.  
- If a neighbor is **off**, it becomes **on**.  
- **The chosen candle itself does not change**.

---

#### 2. Counting the Number of Lit Candles
- Start with **2 lit candles** (an even number).
- Each operation toggles **exactly two candles**, so:
  - If you start with an even number of lit candles, after each operation, you will still have an even number of lit candles.

---

#### 3. Can You Reach 2014 Lit Candles?
- The final goal is to light all **2014 candles**.  
- Since **2014 is an even number**, the number of lit candles could match the goal in terms of count.  
  But there is more to consider.

---

### The Key Insight: Local Operations Limit the Spread
- Every operation **only affects two neighboring candles**.  
- Since you are starting with **two isolated lit candles**, there is **no way to spread the ignition around the entire circle** with this toggle rule.  
- **No sequence of local changes** can make the entire circle of candles lit starting from a finite initial lit configuration.

---

### Why This Matters
The combination of:
1. **Parity rule (even count of lit candles)** — The total count remains even, but that does not guarantee you can change the pattern to all candles lit.  
2. **Local effect of toggling neighbors** — The operations are limited to affecting only **adjacent candles**, making it impossible to ignite **the entire circle** from just two lit candles.

---

### Conclusion
It is **impossible** to light all 2014 candles starting with just 2 lit candles using the rule that toggles the neighboring candles. This is due to the **local nature** of the toggle operation and the **inability to propagate the ignition pattern fully** around the circle.
