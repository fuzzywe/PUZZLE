Puzzle | Heaven and Hell
Last Updated : 30 Apr, 2024
There are two gates, one to hell and the other to heaven. Two gatekeepers, one for each gate. One of them always speaks 

the truth and the other always lies but you don’t know which one guards which gate. You are allowed only one question 


and you need to find out the gate to heaven. What is the question?    

 
 Let's break down the "Heaven and Hell" puzzle step by step with simpler examples and explanations. 

### Puzzle Recap
1. **Two Doors**: One leads to Heaven (the "good" door) and the other to Hell (the "bad" door).
2. **Two Guards**: 
   - One always **tells the truth**.
   - The other always **lies**.
3. You don't know which door leads where, and you also don't know which guard is the truth-teller and which is the liar.
4. You can ask **one question to one guard** to figure out which door leads to Heaven.

### Goal
You need to ask a question that will give you the correct answer, no matter which guard you ask.

### Solution with an Example

The best question to ask is:
> "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to Heaven, what would they say?"

Then, you go through the **opposite door** of the one they indicate.

#### Why This Works
Let’s walk through two scenarios to understand why this question always works.

### Scenario 1: Asking the Truthful Guard

1. Let’s say **Door A leads to Heaven** and **Door B leads to Hell**.
2. You decide to ask the **truthful guard** the question: "If I were to ask the other guard (the liar) which door leads to Heaven, what would they say?"
3. Here’s what happens:
   - The **truthful guard** knows that the **liar** would try to deceive you and point to the **Hell door (Door B)**.
   - Since the truthful guard is telling the truth, they honestly tell you, "The other guard would say Door B."
   
So if the truthful guard points to Door B, you know that Door B is the wrong door, and the opposite door (Door A) must lead to Heaven.

### Scenario 2: Asking the Liar

1. Again, let’s say **Door A leads to Heaven** and **Door B leads to Hell**.
2. This time, you decide to ask the **lying guard** the same question: "If I were to ask the other guard (the truthful one) which door leads to Heaven, what would they say?"
3. Here’s what happens:
   - The **liar** knows that the **truthful guard** would correctly point to the **Heaven door (Door A)**.
   - But since you’re asking the liar, they will lie about this answer and point you to the **opposite door (Door B)**.

So if the lying guard also points to Door B, you know that Door B is the wrong door, and the opposite door (Door A) must lead to Heaven.

---

### Summary of the Logic
No matter which guard you ask:
- Both the truthful guard and the lying guard will point to the **Hell door** (Door B in our example).
- That means you should always pick the **opposite door** (Door A), which will lead to Heaven.

---

### Why This Works
The key to this puzzle is that:
- Asking each guard about the **other guard's answer** forces both the truth-teller and the liar to point to the wrong door (Hell).
- By taking the opposite door, you ensure you’re picking the right door (Heaven).

I hope this breakdown makes it clearer!
