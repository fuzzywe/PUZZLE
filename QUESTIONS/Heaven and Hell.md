Puzzle | Heaven and Hell
Last Updated : 30 Apr, 2024
There are two gates, one to hell and the other to heaven. Two gatekeepers, one for each gate. One of them always speaks 

the truth and the other always lies but you don’t know which one guards which gate. You are allowed only one question 


and you need to find out the gate to heaven. What is the question?    

 
 Solution: “If I were to ask the other gatekeeper which gate leads to heaven, what would they say?”

Here’s how it works:

If you ask the truthful gatekeeper, they would truthfully tell you what the lying gatekeeper would say. So, they would

point you towards the gate to hell, because they know the lying gatekeeper would falsely point to hell as well.

If you ask the lying gatekeeper, they would lie about what the truthful gatekeeper would say. Therefore, they would 

also point you towards the gate to hell, because they know the truthful gatekeeper would truthfully point to heaven.

In both scenarios, regardless of who you ask, you’ll receive the same answer: the gate to hell.

Hence, it would be best if you chose the other gate, which is the gate to heaven.
