Precious Stones and Greedy Bandits
 

There are ten bandits named as ’A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘I’, ‘J’ they stole some precious stones from a temple, and they decided to divide these stones equally among themselves. So they split the stones into ten parts, but the last bandit, ‘J’ got one stone less than other bandits. So the remaining nine bandits murder ‘J’. They again decided to divide the stones into nine parts. But this time again, the last bandit ‘I’ got one less stone than other bandits. So again, the remaining 8 bandits murder ‘I’ and divide all stones between the remaining 8 bandits. But again, this time, ‘H’ got one less stone than the other. This process goes on until 1 bandit is left, i.e., ‘A’. After that, ‘A’ takes all the stones and runs away. Now you have to guess the total number of stones.

Let's walk through this problem step by step in a simple way.

### **Understanding the Problem**
1. There are **10 bandits**, and they stole some stones.
2. When they tried to divide the stones **among all 10**, the last bandit (J) got **one less stone** than the others. This means:
   - If there were enough stones to divide **equally**, it would be divisible by 10. But it’s **one stone short** of being divisible by 10.

3. Then they killed one bandit (J), leaving **9 bandits**.  
   - When dividing the stones **among 9**, the last bandit (I) got **one less stone** than the others. So the total is **one short** of being divisible by 9.

4. This continues until there is **only 1 bandit left (A)**, who takes all the stones.

### **The Goal**
We want to find the smallest possible number of stones, **N**, that works with all these conditions.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**
#### Condition 1: Divisible by 10 with 1 stone short
This means:

### **The Shortcut**
Since each condition subtracts 1 from a divisible number, the answer is related to finding a number that satisfies **all divisibilities from 2 to 10**, **minus 1**. The smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 10 is the **least common multiple (LCM) of 1 to 10**.

The **LCM of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10** is:

This is the smallest number that satisfies all the conditions for dividing among the bandits.  
So, the answer is **2519 stones**.

### **Why Does This Work?**
Each condition fits the form of subtracting 1 from a perfect division:
- \( N \equiv 9 \pmod{10} \) because the last one is always short of an even split.
- LCM ensures all these division rules are met at the same time.
