A group of 25 warriors had to cross a broad and deep river with no bridge in sight. They notice two 10-year-old boys playing in a rowboat by the shore. The problem is that the boat is so small that it can only hold two boys or one warrior. How can the warriors get across the river and leave the boys in joint possession of the boat?
This problem can be solved using strategic use of the boat and multiple trips. Letâ€™s walk through the solution step-by-step.

### Key Facts
- **25 warriors** need to cross the river.
- **2 boys** and a **rowboat** are available.
- The boat can only hold **either two boys or one warrior** at a time.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initial trip (Boys cross the river)**  
   The two boys row across the river together.  
   - Now, both boys are on the **opposite side** of the river.

2. **One boy returns with the boat**  
   One boy rows back alone to the starting side.  
   - Now, one boy is on each side of the river.

3. **A warrior crosses**  
   One warrior rows across the river alone.  
   - Now, one warrior and one boy are on the opposite side.

4. **The boy on the opposite side returns**  
   The boy on the opposite side rows back alone.  
   - Now, both boys are back on the starting side.

5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4**  
   For each warrior that crosses, a boy returns with the boat to fetch the next warrior. This process repeats until all **25 warriors** have crossed.

### Final Step
After the last warrior crosses, both boys row across the river together, leaving them on the same side as the warriors with the boat.

---

### Total Trips
- The boys make an initial trip across together.
- One boy returns each time a warrior crosses, requiring 25 returns.
- After the last warrior crosses, both boys row across once more.

The process uses **1 trip for each warrior plus 2 additional trips** for the boys, making a total of **25 + 2 = 27 trips**.

---

### Summary
All 25 warriors and both boys end up on the far side of the river, with the boys retaining joint possession of the boat.
