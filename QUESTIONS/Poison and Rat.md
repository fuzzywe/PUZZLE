There are 1000 wine bottles. One of the bottles contains poisoned wine. A rat dies after one hour of drinking the poisoned wine. How many minimum rats are needed to figure out which bottle contains poison in hour.

Solution:
We need to figure out in hour. We need 10 rats to figure out the poisoned bottle. The result is based on binary number system. We get 10 using ? Log21000 ?.  

The idea is to number bottles from 1 to 1000 and write their corresponding binary numbers on the bottle. Each rat is assigned a position in the binary numbers written on bottles. Let us take an example. Rat 1 represents first bit in every bottle, rat 2 represents second bit and so on. If rat numbers 5, 7 and 9 die, then bottle number 42 (Binary 0000101010) is poisoned.\

This puzzle uses binary representation to solve the problem with minimal rats. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works and why we need exactly 10 rats.

### Key Points of the Puzzle
- There are 1000 wine bottles, and one of them is poisoned.
- A rat will die within an hour if it drinks from the poisoned bottle, and we want to find the poisoned bottle in one hour.
- We need to determine the minimum number of rats required to identify the poisoned bottle in a single test.

### Solution Approach Using Binary Representation
1. **Binary Representation and Rats as Bits**:
   - Every number from 1 to 1000 can be represented in binary.
   - In binary, the number 1000 requires 10 bits (since \(2^{10} = 1024\), which covers all numbers up to 1000).
   - We can use the binary positions as instructions for which rats to give wine from each bottle.

2. **Assigning Bottles to Rats Based on Binary Digits**:
   - Number the bottles from 1 to 1000.
   - Convert each bottle number to a 10-bit binary number (padded with leading zeroes if necessary).
   - Assign each rat to a specific bit position in this binary number.
      - Rat 1 represents the **rightmost bit (least significant bit)**.
      - Rat 2 represents the **second bit from the right**, and so on, up to Rat 10 for the **leftmost bit (most significant bit)**.

3. **Testing Procedure**:
   - For each bottle, look at its binary representation.
   - If a bit is set to 1 in the binary number, the corresponding rat drinks from that bottle.
   - For example:
     - Bottle number 42 in binary is `0000101010`.
     - Rats 5, 7, and 9 would drink from bottle 42 because those positions are `1` in the binary representation.

4. **Determining the Poisoned Bottle**:
   - After one hour, observe which rats have died.
   - The combination of rats that died corresponds to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.
   - Convert this binary number back to a decimal to identify the exact bottle.

### Why 10 Rats Are Sufficient
- Since there are 1000 bottles, we need to cover a range of 1000 possible outcomes.
- 10 rats can represent up to \(2^{10} = 1024\) combinations in binary, which is sufficient to cover all 1000 bottles.
- Using fewer than 10 rats would not provide enough unique combinations to cover all 1000 bottles.

### Example to Illustrate
Suppose the poisoned bottle is bottle number 42:
1. Bottle number 42 in binary is `0000101010`.
2. Rats assigned to bits 5, 7, and 9 would drink from this bottle.
3. If these rats die, we interpret their binary positions to identify bottle 42 as poisoned.

### Summary
- **Minimum Rats Needed**: 10
- **Reason**: Using binary representation, 10 rats can create up to 1024 unique combinations, covering all 1000 bottles.
