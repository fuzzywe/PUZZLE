Puzzle 5 | (Finding the Injection for Anesthesia)
Last Updated : 16 Feb, 2023
In a Medical Laboratory, you have 240 Injections, one of which is for Anesthesia for a rat. If Anesthesia injection is injected in a rat, it will faint in within 24 hours. You have 5 rats available to determine which one injection contains the Anesthesia. How do you achieve this in 48 hours ? 

Clarifications:

1. If a rat faints, it cannot be used again.

2. If a rat receives the anesthesia injection, it can faint at any point in time within a 24-hour window (not necessarily exactly 24 hours from the injection time

3. Given that we have 240 injections and only 5 rats, we can use a binary encoding approach to identify the anesthesia injection with these rats. Here’s how it works:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Assign Binary Codes**:
   - Number the injections from 1 to 240.
   - Convert each injection number into a **5-bit binary code**. 
   - For example:
     - Injection 1 → 00001
     - Injection 2 → 00010
     - Injection 3 → 00011
     - ...
     - Injection 240 → 11110

2. **Map Rats to Binary Positions**:
   - Assign each rat to a binary position (1 for each bit). 
     - Rat 1 represents the **first (least significant) bit**.
     - Rat 2 represents the **second bit**.
     - Rat 3 represents the **third bit**.
     - Rat 4 represents the **fourth bit**.
     - Rat 5 represents the **fifth (most significant) bit**.

3. **Inject Rats Based on Binary Encoding**:
   - For each injection, check its binary representation and inject each rat according to the bits in that binary code.
   - If a bit is **1**, the corresponding rat receives that injection.
   - For instance:
     - Injection 1 (00001): Inject only Rat 1.
     - Injection 2 (00010): Inject only Rat 2.
     - Injection 3 (00011): Inject Rats 1 and 2.
     - Injection 240 (11110): Inject Rats 2, 3, 4, and 5.

4. **Wait for 24 Hours**:
   - After 24 hours, observe which rats fainted.
   - The pattern of fainted rats gives a **unique 5-bit binary code**, which corresponds to the binary code of the anesthesia injection.

5. **Interpret the Result**:
   - Suppose Rat 1 and Rat 3 fainted, while Rats 2, 4, and 5 did not. This would give a fainting pattern of 00101.
   - Convert this pattern back into decimal (00101 in binary is 5), indicating that **Injection 5** is the anesthesia injection.

### Example Walkthrough

- Say Injection 165 is the anesthesia injection.
- **Binary for 165** is **10101**.
  - According to this binary code, inject **Rats 1, 3, and 5** with Injection 165.
- After 24 hours, if Rats 1, 3, and 5 faint, we get the binary code **10101**, which confirms Injection 165 is the anesthesia injection.

### Summary

By using binary encoding with only 5 rats, you can uniquely identify any of the 240 injections within 48 hours. The 24-hour period provides enough time to observe the fainting pattern and determine the anesthesia injection based on the binary code formed by the fainting rats.
