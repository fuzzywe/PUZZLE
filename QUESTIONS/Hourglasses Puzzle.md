The Hourglasses Puzzle is a popular time-related puzzle involving hourglasses (sand timers) with different durations. The objective is typically to measure a specific time using these hourglasses, which don’t necessarily measure standard times (like 5 minutes or 10 minutes), making it challenging to achieve the goal.

### Puzzle Example
Let’s consider a typical example:

**Puzzle**: You have a 7-minute hourglass and an 11-minute hourglass. How can you use these hourglasses to measure exactly 15 minutes?

### Solution Steps
1. **Start Both Hourglasses** (0 min):
   - Flip both the 7-minute and 11-minute hourglasses at the same time.

2. **After 7 Minutes** (7 min):
   - The 7-minute hourglass runs out of sand. Flip it over immediately to start it again.
   - The 11-minute hourglass still has 4 minutes remaining.

3. **After 11 Minutes** (11 min):
   - The 11-minute hourglass runs out of sand. Flip it over immediately to start it again.
   - The 7-minute hourglass has 3 minutes of sand remaining.

4. **After 14 Minutes** (14 min):
   - The 7-minute hourglass runs out again. Flip it over immediately.
   - The 11-minute hourglass has 7 minutes of sand left from the most recent flip.

5. **After 15 Minutes** (15 min):
   - Exactly 1 minute after the 7-minute hourglass was flipped for the third time, it will have counted an additional minute, reaching the 15-minute mark.

This solution uses the relative timing of each hourglass running out to achieve the precise time goal. In this case, after 15 minutes, you will have measured the exact desired time.

### Explanation
The key to solving these puzzles is to strategically flip the hourglasses whenever they run out, using them as “partial” timers to accumulate the desired time. This approach can be adapted for other time targets and different hourglass durations by experimenting with flipping the hourglasses in sync or offset to achieve the required timing.
