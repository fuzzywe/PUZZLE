We are given the problem of two people, Max and Bruce, selling footballs at different rates. Let’s carefully solve this step-by-step.

### **Step 1: Define the variables**
Let’s assume:  
- Max had **x** footballs.  
- Bruce also had **x** footballs (since it says they have an equal number of footballs).  
- So, the total number of footballs is **2x**.

### **Step 2: Prices of footballs when sold separately**
- Max sells footballs at **2 footballs per dollar**.  
  So, if he has **x** footballs, the total money he would make is:

### **Step 3: Selling the mixed footballs**
- They mix all the footballs, so the total number of footballs is **2x**.  
- The combined selling rate is **5 footballs for 2 dollars**.  
  - This means for every 5 footballs, they earn 2 dollars.

### **Step 6: The answer**
Since **x = 210**, each of them had **210 footballs** initially.

### **Final Answer**
Max and Bruce each had **210 footballs** initially.
