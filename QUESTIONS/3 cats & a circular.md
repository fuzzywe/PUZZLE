We want to find the probability that three cats moving along a circular maze in random directions will not collide. Letâ€™s break this down step-by-step.

### Key Assumptions
1. The maze is circular.
2. Cats start at **different positions** on the circle.
3. Each cat can move in **one of two directions**: clockwise or counterclockwise.
4. The movement is continuous around the circle, so they could potentially meet.

### Step 1: Count the Total Possible Movements
Each of the three cats can independently choose a direction:
- Cat 1 can go **clockwise or counterclockwise** (2 choices).
- Cat 2 can go **clockwise or counterclockwise** (2 choices).
- Cat 3 can go **clockwise or counterclockwise** (2 choices).

Thus, the total number of possible ways the cats can move is:
2*2*2=8

---

### Step 2: Identify Collision-Free Outcomes
For the cats **not** to collide, they must all move in the **same direction**:
- Either **all cats move clockwise** (1 possibility).
- Or **all cats move counterclockwise** (1 possibility).

These are the **only two outcomes** where there are no collisions.

---

### Step 3: Compute the Probability
The favorable outcomes (no collisions) are 2, and the total number of possible outcomes is 8. So, the probability that the cats do not collide is:
2/8=1/4

---

### Final Answer
The probability that none of the cats collides on the circular maze is 1/4
