Mislabeled Jars


The "Mislabeled Jars" puzzle is a classic logic problem involving three jars, each mislabeled. Here’s how it goes:

### Puzzle Setup
You have:
1. **Three jars** that are mislabeled:
   - One jar is labeled "Apples"
   - One jar is labeled "Oranges"
   - One jar is labeled "Apples and Oranges"
   
2. Each jar actually contains only **one type of fruit**, either apples or oranges, but all jars are labeled incorrectly.

3. **Goal**: Determine the correct label for each jar by picking **one fruit from only one jar**.

### Solution

To solve this puzzle, follow these steps:

1. **Start with the jar labeled "Apples and Oranges"**:
   - Since all jars are mislabeled, this jar cannot contain both apples and oranges. It must contain only apples or only oranges.
   - Pick one fruit from this jar to see what’s inside.

2. **Identify the contents of the jar you picked**:
   - If you pull out an apple, then this jar must contain only apples (because it can’t be the mixed jar).
   - If you pull out an orange, then this jar must contain only oranges.

3. **Relabel the remaining jars**:
   - Now, you know the true contents of the "Apples and Oranges" jar.
   - You also know the remaining two jars are mislabeled. Since they each contain only one type of fruit and each label is wrong, you can deduce the contents based on the mislabeling:
     - The jar labeled "Oranges" must contain apples (because it’s mislabeled).
     - The jar labeled "Apples" must contain oranges (because it’s also mislabeled).

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through an example with the following setup:
   - "Apples" jar (incorrectly labeled) actually contains oranges.
   - "Oranges" jar (incorrectly labeled) actually contains apples.
   - "Apples and Oranges" jar (incorrectly labeled) actually contains oranges.

1. You pick a fruit from the jar labeled "Apples and Oranges" and pull out an **orange**.
2. Now you know:
   - The jar labeled "Apples and Oranges" actually contains only oranges.
   
3. Based on the mislabeling:
   - The jar labeled "Oranges" must actually contain apples.
   - The jar labeled "Apples" must contain oranges.

---

### Final Answer:
1. The jar labeled "Apples" actually contains oranges.
2. The jar labeled "Oranges" actually contains apples.
3. The jar labeled "Apples and Oranges" actually contains oranges.

This strategy allows you to correctly identify the contents of each jar with just one fruit pull.
