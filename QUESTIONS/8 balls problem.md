 The "8 Balls Problem" is a popular logic puzzle that involves identifying an odd ball (one that is either heavier or lighter) among 8 otherwise identical balls. You can use a **balance scale** and have **only two weighings** to find the odd ball and determine if it’s heavier or lighter.

Here's how to solve it:

### Problem Setup
- You have **8 balls**; one of them is either **heavier or lighter** than the others.
- You can use a **balance scale** for only **two weighings**.
- The goal is to find the odd ball and determine if it’s heavier or lighter.

### Solution

#### Step 1: Split the Balls into Groups
1. Divide the 8 balls into **three groups**:
   - Group 1: Balls 1, 2, 3
   - Group 2: Balls 4, 5, 6
   - Group 3: Balls 7, 8

#### Step 2: First Weighing
1. **Weigh Group 1 (Balls 1, 2, 3) against Group 2 (Balls 4, 5, 6)**.

2. There are two possible outcomes for this weighing:
   - **Outcome A: The scale balances** (Groups 1 and 2 are equal).
   - **Outcome B: The scale is unbalanced** (one group is heavier or lighter).

#### Step 3: Analyze Each Outcome

**Outcome A: The Scale Balances**
   - Since the scale is balanced, you know that **all balls in Groups 1 and 2 are normal**.
   - Therefore, the odd ball must be in **Group 3 (Balls 7 and 8)**.
   - **Second Weighing**: Weigh Ball 7 against Ball 8.
     - If Ball 7 and Ball 8 balance, then there is no odd ball among them, meaning there’s an error in the question premise (rare in well-designed puzzles).
     - If Ball 7 and Ball 8 do not balance, the heavier or lighter ball is the odd one, and you’ve identified whether it’s heavier or lighter.

**Outcome B: The Scale is Unbalanced**
   - In this case, one of the balls in **Group 1 or Group 2 is the odd ball**, and it’s either heavier or lighter.
   - **Second Weighing**: Pick any two balls from the heavier group (e.g., Balls 1 and 2) and weigh them against each other.
     - If they balance, then the odd ball is the remaining ball in that group (Ball 3), and the direction of imbalance in the first weighing tells you whether it’s heavier or lighter.
     - If they do not balance, then the heavier or lighter ball in this weighing is the odd ball, and you know if it’s heavier or lighter based on the imbalance.

By following these steps, you can find the odd ball in two weighings and determine if it’s heavier or lighter.
