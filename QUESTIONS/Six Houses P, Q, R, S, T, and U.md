Puzzle | Six Houses P, Q, R, S, T, and U
Last Updated : 18 Jan, 2023
There are three houses on each side of the road. These six houses are labeled as P, Q, R, S, T, and U. The houses are of different colors, namely, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, and White. The houses are of different heights.

T, the tallest house, is exactly opposite to the Red-colored house.
The shortest house is exactly opposite to the Green colored house.
U, the Orange colored house, is located between P and S.
R, the Yellow-colored house, is exactly opposite to P.
Q, the Green colored house, is exactly opposite to U.
P, the white-colored house, is taller than R, but shorter than S and Q.
What is the color of the tallest house and how many houses are taller than the house R?

Let’s go over **Step 2** carefully to make it clearer. The goal is to arrange the six houses in two rows along the road, with each house on one side of the road having a house directly opposite it on the other side. Here’s a clearer breakdown:

### Understanding the Layout
We have two sides of the road, each with three houses:
- **Side 1** has houses \( P \), \( U \), and \( S \) (in some order).
- **Side 2** has houses \( Q \), \( R \), and \( T \) (in some order).

Each house on **Side 1** will be opposite one of the houses on **Side 2**.

### Analyzing **Clues 3 and 5**
Let's look at these clues first because they help us start positioning some houses.

- **Clue 3**: **U, the Orange-colored house, is between P and S.**  
  This tells us that on **Side 1**, the order of the houses must be \( P \), \( U \), and \( S \) (not necessarily in this exact left-to-right order, but they’re on the same side). So now we know:
  - **Side 1** has the sequence: \( P, U, S \).

- **Clue 5**: **Q, the Green-colored house, is exactly opposite U.**  
  Since \( U \) is on **Side 1**, \( Q \) must be on **Side 2**, and it is directly opposite \( U \).

So, based on Clues 3 and 5, we now have:
- **Side 1**: \( P, U, S \)
- **Side 2**: \( Q \), with \( Q \) opposite \( U \).

### Analyzing **Clue 4**
Now, let’s use **Clue 4**:
- **Clue 4**: **R, the Yellow-colored house, is exactly opposite P.**

Since \( P \) is on **Side 1**, \( R \) must be on **Side 2** and is directly opposite \( P \).

Now our layout looks like this:
- **Side 1**: \( P, U, S \)
- **Side 2**: \( Q, R, T \) (with \( Q \) opposite \( U \) and \( R \) opposite \( P \)).

### Summary of the Layout So Far
1. **Side 1**: \( P, U, S \) (we know the order must be this way because of Clues 3 and 5).
2. **Side 2**: \( Q, R, T \), where:
   - \( Q \) is opposite \( U \).
   - \( R \) is opposite \( P \).
   - \( T \) (the remaining house on Side 2) must be opposite \( S \).
  
3. Let's analyze each clue and organize the information step-by-step to solve the puzzle.

### Information Given:
1. **Six houses** on each side of the road: \( P, Q, R, S, T, U \).
2. Each house has a **different color**: Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, White.
3. Each house has a **different height**.

### Clues:
1. **T, the tallest house, is exactly opposite the Red-colored house.**
2. **The shortest house is exactly opposite the Green-colored house.**
3. **U, the Orange-colored house, is located between P and S.**
4. **R, the Yellow-colored house, is exactly opposite P.**
5. **Q, the Green-colored house, is exactly opposite U.**
6. **P, the White-colored house, is taller than R, but shorter than S and Q.**

### Solution:
Let’s go through each clue in detail to place the houses.

---

**Step 1:** Analyze **Clue 3** and **Clue 5**

- From **Clue 3**: **U, the Orange-colored house, is between P and S**.
- From **Clue 5**: **Q is the Green-colored house and is exactly opposite U**.

Since U is between P and S, they must all be on the same side of the road. Let's assume that side has houses \( P, U, S \) (in some order), while the opposite side has \( Q \), and \( Q \) is directly opposite \( U \).

So, one side could be:
- **Side 1**: \( P, U, S \)
- **Side 2**: \( Q, R, T \) (with \( Q \) directly opposite \( U \))

---

**Step 2:** Analyze **Clue 4**

- **R is the Yellow-colored house and is exactly opposite P**.

Since \( P \) is on Side 1, \( R \) must be on Side 2 and is directly opposite \( P \).

Now we have a layout:
- **Side 1**: \( P, U, S \)
- **Side 2**: \( Q, R, T \) (with \( Q \) opposite \( U \) and \( R \) opposite \( P \))

---

**Step 3:** Analyze **Clues 1 and 2**

- **Clue 1**: \( T \) is the tallest house and is exactly opposite the Red-colored house.
- **Clue 2**: The shortest house is exactly opposite the Green-colored house.

From **Clue 5**, we know \( Q \) is the Green-colored house, so the shortest house must be exactly opposite \( Q \). This makes \( U \) the shortest house since \( U \) is opposite \( Q \).

Now we know:
- \( T \) is the tallest house.
- \( U \) is the shortest house.
- \( T \) is opposite the Red-colored house.

Since \( R \) is opposite \( P \) and \( Q \) is opposite \( U \), \( T \) must be opposite \( S \). Therefore:
- **S is the Red-colored house.**

---

**Step 4:** Analyze **Clue 6**

- **P, the White-colored house, is taller than R, but shorter than S and Q.**

Since \( T \) is the tallest, and \( U \) is the shortest, we can arrange the heights as follows:
1. **Tallest**: \( T \)
2. \( Q \) (Green)
3. \( S \) (Red)
4. \( P \) (White)
5. \( R \) (Yellow)
6. **Shortest**: \( U \) (Orange)

### Summary:

- **Colors**:
  - \( P \): White
  - \( Q \): Green
  - \( R \): Yellow
  - \( S \): Red
  - \( T \): Blue (by elimination)
  - \( U \): Orange

- **Heights**:
  - \( T \): Tallest
  - \( U \): Shortest
  - \( P \) is taller than \( R \) but shorter than \( S \) and \( Q \).

### Answer:

- **The color of the tallest house (T) is Blue**.
- **There are three houses taller than R**: \( T \), \( Q \), and \( S \).
