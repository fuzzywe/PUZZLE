Sure, let’s go over these puzzles with a more visual approach:

### 1. **3 Ants and a Triangle**

Imagine an equilateral triangle with points labeled A, B, and C, where each vertex has one ant. Each ant can go clockwise or counterclockwise along the triangle's edges.

**Visual Explanation:**
- Each ant has two choices (clockwise or counterclockwise), creating these paths:
  
   | Direction | Ant at A | Ant at B | Ant at C |
   |-----------|----------|----------|----------|
   | 1         | CW       | CW       | CW       |
   | 2         | CW       | CW       | CCW      |
   | 3         | CW       | CCW      | CW       |
   | 4         | CW       | CCW      | CCW      |
   | 5         | CCW      | CW       | CW       |
   | 6         | CCW      | CW       | CCW      |
   | 7         | CCW      | CCW      | CW       |
   | 8         | CCW      | CCW      | CCW      |

- Only scenarios **1** and **8** have all ants moving in the same direction, preventing collision.

**Probability Calculation:**
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Collision-Free Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

So, there's a **1/4 chance that none of the ants will collide**.

### 2. **3 Bulbs and 3 Switches**

This puzzle is about associating each switch with a bulb in a room you can visit only once.

**Steps Visualized:**
1. **Room with Switches:** Number the switches as Switch 1, Switch 2, and Switch 3.
   
2. **First Action:** 
   - Turn on Switch 1 and leave it on for a few minutes.
   
3. **Second Action:** 
   - Turn off Switch 1 and turn on Switch 2. Then go to the bulb room.

**Interpretation of the Bulbs:**
- **Bulb that's On:** This is connected to **Switch 2** (the last switch you turned on).
- **Bulb that's Off but Warm:** This is connected to **Switch 1** (the switch you turned on first and then turned off).
- **Bulb that's Off and Cool:** This is connected to **Switch 3** (never turned on).

So, you can identify which switch controls each bulb based on the bulbs’ states and temperatures.

### 3. **Coins Puzzle** (Common Version with 10 Coins)

Imagine you have a row of 10 coins, all heads-up initially:

```
Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads  Heads
```

**First Step: Flip Every Second Coin Starting from the First Coin:**
1. Flip coin 1, coin 3, coin 5, etc., so you get:

```
Tails  Heads  Tails  Heads  Tails  Heads  Tails  Heads  Tails  Heads
```

**Second Step: Flip Every Second Coin Starting from the Second Coin:**
1. Now flip coin 2, coin 4, coin 6, etc., so you get:

```
Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails  Tails
```

All coins are now **tails-up**.

If you clarify the puzzle's setup, I can help with a different arrangement if needed.
