A shepherd has 100 sheep numbered from 1 to 100. Every sheep gives wool according to their numbers, i.e., i’th sheep gives i kg wool. Shepherd has 10 sons, and he wants to divide his sheep among his 10 sons so that every son should get an equal amount of wool. The task is to help him know about these sheep’s division among the sons.

Solution:

As we know that the i’th sheep gives i kg wool. So first, let us count the total kg of wool obtained from these sheep. This can be solved by using the arithmetic progression sum.

 

We know that sum of n numbers starting from 1 is always, sum = n*(n+1)/2.

 

So the total quantity of wool obtained from 100 sheep is total wool = 100(100+1)/2=5050 kgs.

 

As the problem says, the division of the sheep should be done so that every son gets an equal amount of wool. So every son should get 5050/10 = 505 kgs of wool.

 

Our main problem is to divide 1 to 100 numbers so that every son should get 10 sheep who sum up to 505.

 

Let us reduce the complexity of this puzzle using the below example:

Now let us suppose you have 10 numbers and you divide them into 5 people so that each one gets an equal sum of these numbers.

 

So these 10 numbers sum up to 55 now each of the 5 people will get 11 as a sum so it's obvious that every people will get two numbers whose sum is 11. so the division would be like this:

First_Person —> 1, 10

Second_Person —> 2, 9

Third_Person —> 3, 8

Fourth_Person —> 4, 7

Fifth_Person —> 5, 6

so each person will get 11.

Now coming back to the problem, we have 100 numbers we have to divide this into 10 groups so that each son get 505 kg of wool. So,

First_Son —> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100

Second_Son —> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95

Third_Son —> 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90

Fourth_Son —> 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85

Fifth_Son —> 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80

Sith_Son —> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75

Seventh_Son —> 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70

Eighth_Son —> 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65

Ninth_Son —> 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60

Tenth_Son —> 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55

as the problem said each son should get an equal amount of wool.
