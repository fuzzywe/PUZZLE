Last Updated : 18 Jan, 2023
Question: 
In the forest, a girl encounters a lion and a unicorn. Every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, the lion tells lies, but on the other days, he tells the truth. The unicorn tells the truth the rest of the week but lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The lion confessed to the girl, “Yesterday I was lying.” So was I, the unicorn said. When is it today?
