Puzzle 2 | (Find the ages of daughters)
Last Updated : 27 Jun, 2023
Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him a first hint. 


Find the ages of daughters


1. The product of their age is 72. 


Shyam says this is not enough information Alok gives him a second hint. 


2. The sum of their ages is equal to my house number. 


Shyam goes out and looks at the house number and tells “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”. 


Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint 


3. The oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. 


Shyam is able to guess after the third hint. Can you guess what are the ages of the three daughters? 

1. Product of ages is 72 


Below are all possibilities to get 72 from product of three different ages: 


1 * 1 * 72 = 72 


1 * 2 * 36 = 72 


1 * 3 * 24 = 72 


1 * 4 * 18 = 72 


1 * 6 * 12 = 72 


1 * 8 * 9 = 72 


2 * 2 * 18 = 72 


2 * 3 * 12 = 72 


2 * 4 * 9 = 72 


2 * 6 * 6 = 72 


3 * 3 * 8 = 72 


3 * 4 * 6 = 72 


2. Sum of the ages is given 


1 + 1 + 72 = 74 


1 + 2 + 36 = 39 


1 + 3 + 24 = 28 


1 + 4 + 18 = 23 


1 + 6 + 12 = 19 


1 + 8 + 9 = 18 


2 + 2 + 18 = 22 


2 + 3 + 12 = 17 


2 + 4 + 9 = 15 


2 + 6 + 6 = 14 


3 + 3 + 8 = 14 


3 + 4 + 6 = 13 


All sums are unique except 14. So the age sum must have been 14, otherwise, Shyam would have guessed the ages from hint 2 only. 


So we have two possible combinations to get a sum of 14 


2 + 6 + 6 = 14 


3 + 3 + 8 = 14 


3.  Alok has the oldest girl (not two!!). So the ages must be 3, 3 and 8.

4.  This is a classic math puzzle! Here’s how it goes:

A father says to his friend, “I have three daughters, and the product of their ages is 72. The sum of their ages is the same as the number on that building across the street.”  
The friend looks at the building number and says, “I still don’t know their ages.”  
The father then says, “Oh, I forgot to tell you that my oldest daughter likes chocolate cake.”  
With this final clue, the friend now knows their ages.  

Let’s solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Possible Age Combinations
First, we find all possible combinations of ages for three daughters whose ages multiply to 72. We also calculate the sum for each combination.

1. **Ages:** 1, 1, 72 — **Sum:** 74  
2. **Ages:** 1, 2, 36 — **Sum:** 39  
3. **Ages:** 1, 3, 24 — **Sum:** 28  
4. **Ages:** 1, 4, 18 — **Sum:** 23  
5. **Ages:** 1, 6, 12 — **Sum:** 19  
6. **Ages:** 1, 8, 9 — **Sum:** 18  
7. **Ages:** 2, 2, 18 — **Sum:** 22  
8. **Ages:** 2, 3, 12 — **Sum:** 17  
9. **Ages:** 2, 4, 9 — **Sum:** 15  
10. **Ages:** 2, 6, 6 — **Sum:** 14  
11. **Ages:** 3, 3, 8 — **Sum:** 14  
12. **Ages:** 3, 4, 6 — **Sum:** 13  

### Step 2: Interpret the Clue About the Building Number
The friend sees the building number but still doesn’t know the ages. This means that the sum of the ages must appear in the list more than once because otherwise, the friend would have been able to determine the ages immediately.

Looking at our sums, the only repeated sum is **14**.

So, the possible age combinations for a sum of 14 are:
- **Ages 2, 6, 6**
- **Ages 3, 3, 8**

### Step 3: Use the Final Clue about the "Oldest" Daughter
The father mentions an “oldest” daughter, which implies there is only one daughter with the highest age. This rules out the combination **2, 6, 6** (since there would be two oldest daughters, both aged 6).

Thus, the only possible ages are:
- **3, 3, and 8**

### Solution
The ages of the three daughters are **3, 3, and 8**.
