To calculate the memory address of the element Arr[5][6] in a 2D float array Arr[10][10], we can use the following formula for the address calculation:

Address(Arr[i][j])=Base Address+(i×Number of Columns+j)×Size of Element

Where:
- Base Address = 2000 (starting address of the array)
- Number of Columns = 10 (since there are 10 columns in the array)
- Size of Element = 4 bytes (size of a float)
- i = 5 (the row index)
- j = 6 (the column index)

Step-by-step Calculation:

    Calculate the index offset:
    Index=i×Number of Columns+j=5×10+6=50+6=56

Calculate the total byte offset:
Byte Offset=Index×Size of Element=56×4=224 bytes
Calculate the final address:
Address(Arr[5][6])=Base Address+Byte Offset=2000+224=222
