Problem: It is known that Cheryl’s birthday is one of the following 10 dates listed in the table.

     May 15,May 16,May 19,June 17,June 18,July 14,
          July 16,August 14,August 15,August 17.

Cheryl tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively.

Then following conversation takes place

Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn’t know too.

Bernard: At first I didn’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now.

Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is.

So when is Cheryl’s birthday?


Let’s go through Cheryl’s Birthday Puzzle step-by-step with the updated list of possible dates and explain each deduction carefully.

### Given Dates
Cheryl’s possible birthday dates are:

- **May**: 15, 16, 19
- **June**: 17, 18
- **July**: 14, 16
- **August**: 14, 15, 17

### Clues Recap

1. **Albert** knows the **month** of Cheryl's birthday.
2. **Bernard** knows the **day** of Cheryl's birthday.
3. **Albert** says, "I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn’t know either."
4. **Bernard** says, "At first, I didn’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but now I know."
5. **Albert** then says, "Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is."

Let's use these clues to find Cheryl’s birthday.

### Step 1: Analyzing Albert’s First Statement

Albert says, "I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn’t know either."

1. Since **Albert knows the month**, his statement tells us something about that month.
2. **If Cheryl’s birthday were in May or June, Bernard might have known the birthday right away**:
   - The day **19** (in May) and **18** (in June) are unique within their months.
   - If Cheryl's birthday were on May 19 or June 18, Bernard would know the date immediately because those dates are unique in those months.

3. Albert’s statement means he **knows** Bernard doesn’t know, which implies Cheryl’s birthday **cannot be in May or June**. 
   - If the month were May or June, there would be a chance that the day was 19 (May) or 18 (June), which would allow Bernard to know the birthday immediately.

**So, we can eliminate all dates in May and June.**

After eliminating May and June, we are left with:

- **July**: 14, 16
- **August**: 14, 15, 17

### Step 2: Analyzing Bernard’s Statement

Now, Bernard says, "At first, I didn’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but now I know."

1. Bernard now knows the exact date, meaning **the day itself must uniquely identify the date**.
2. Looking at the remaining days, we see **14** appears in both **July** and **August**.
   - If the day were **14**, Bernard would still be uncertain because it could be either July 14 or August 14.

3. Since Bernard now knows the date, **the day cannot be 14**.

**So, we eliminate July 14 and August 14.**

Now we’re left with:
- **July 16**
- **August 15**
- **August 17**

---

### Step 3: Analyzing Albert’s Final Statement

Albert then says, "Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is."

1. Since Albert only knows the **month**, this statement means **there’s only one possible date left in his month** among the remaining options.
2. The remaining dates are:
   - **July 16**
   - **August 15**
   - **August 17**

3. If Cheryl’s birthday were in **August**, Albert would see two possible dates left (August 15 and August 17) and wouldn’t be able to determine the exact date.
4. Since Albert can now identify the date, **the month must be July**.

**So, the only possible date left is July 16.**

### Conclusion

Cheryl’s birthday is **July 16**. 

This solution is based on eliminating options step-by-step using each clue to narrow down the possibilities.
