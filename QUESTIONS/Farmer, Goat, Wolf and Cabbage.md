uzzle | Farmer, Goat, Wolf and Cabbage
Last Updated : 25 Jul, 2024
There is a farmer who wishes to cross a river but he is not alone. He also has a goat, a wolf, and a cabbage along with him. There is only one boat available which can support the farmer and either of the goat, wolf or the cabbage. So at a time, the boat can have only two objects (farmer and one other). But the problem is, if the goat and wolf are left alone (either in the boat or onshore), the wolf will eat the goat. Similarly, if the Goat and cabbage are left alone, then goat will eat the cabbage. The farmer wants to cross the river with all three of his belongings: goat, wolf, and cabbage. What strategy he should use to do so?

To solve this puzzle, we need to figure out how the farmer can safely get the goat, wolf, and cabbage across the river without any of them being eaten. Here’s the step-by-step solution:

1. **First Trip**: The farmer takes the **goat** across the river and leaves it on the other side.
   - **Left side**: Wolf and cabbage
   - **Right side**: Goat

2. **Second Trip**: The farmer returns alone to the left side.
   - **Left side**: Wolf and cabbage
   - **Right side**: Goat

3. **Third Trip**: The farmer takes the **cabbage** across the river.
   - **Left side**: Wolf
   - **Right side**: Goat and cabbage

4. **Fourth Trip**: The farmer leaves the cabbage on the right side and **takes the goat back** to the left side.
   - **Left side**: Wolf and goat
   - **Right side**: Cabbage

5. **Fifth Trip**: The farmer takes the **wolf** across the river.
   - **Left side**: Goat
   - **Right side**: Wolf and cabbage

6. **Sixth Trip**: The farmer returns alone to the left side.
   - **Left side**: Goat
   - **Right side**: Wolf and cabbage

7. **Seventh Trip**: Finally, the farmer takes the **goat** across the river.
   - **Left side**: Empty
   - **Right side**: Goat, wolf, and cabbage

Now, all three items—the goat, wolf, and cabbage—are safely on the right side of the river with the farmer.
