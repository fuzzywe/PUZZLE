Puzzle 34 | (Prisoner and Policeman Puzzle)
Last Updated : 10 Jul, 2024
Policeman decided to punish the Prisoner and asked him to make a statement. The Prisoner should make such a statement so that he would be alive. If the statement is held true by Policeman, the Prisoner will be hanged to death and if the statement is held false, the Prisoner will be shot dead.      

Answer:

The Prisoner said, ‘I will be shot dead’.

If the Policeman decides the statement is true, then the Prisoner should be shot dead. However, this contradicts the statement, as the Prisoner would then be hanged instead of being shot.
If the Policeman decides the statement is false, then the Prisoner should be hanged. But this contradicts the decision since the statement being false means the Prisoner should be shot dead.
The paradox arises because whichever option the Policeman chooses, it leads to a contradiction. This paradoxical nature means the Policeman cannot logically decide whether the statement is true or false without causing a contradiction, hence sparing the Prisoner’s life as the decision cannot be made within the rules provided.
