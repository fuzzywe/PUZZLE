### Solution: Egg Drop Problem (with 4 eggs and 30 floors)

You want to find the **lowest floor** in a 30-floor building where an egg breaks, using **4 eggs** and applying a **binary search strategy** to minimize the number of drops.

---

### **Explanation of Binary Search Approach**
1. **Divide and conquer**: Start by dividing the floors into halves each time.  
   This minimizes the number of drops needed because it narrows the search range more efficiently than linear approaches.  
   
   **First drop**:  
   - Start from the middle floor of the entire building (floor 15).  
   - If the egg **breaks** at floor 15, it means the critical floor is between 1 and 15.  
   - If it **doesn‚Äôt break**, the critical floor is between 16 and 30.

2. **Next step**:  
   If the egg didn‚Äôt break at floor 15, the second drop will be from the middle of the range 16 to 30, which is floor 23.  
   - If it **breaks** at floor 23, search between 16 and 23.  
   - If it **doesn‚Äôt break**, search between 24 and 30.

3. **Continue dividing**:  
   Repeat this process, reducing the range by half each time, until you find the **lowest floor** where the egg breaks.

### **Key Steps**
1. Use one egg at a time, testing the middle of the range each time.
2. When an egg breaks, use a new egg to narrow down the lower half of the range.
3. Stop when the exact floor is identified.

### **Number of Drops (Worst Case Scenario)**
Binary search with 30 floors takes approximately:
\[
\log_2(30) \approx 5 \text{ to } 6 \text{ drops}.
\]
With 4 eggs available, you have enough to perform this search strategy efficiently.

### **Summary**
- Use binary search to minimize drops.  
- Maximum drops needed: **5 to 6**.
- Critical floors are determined by halving the search range until the lowest breaking point is found.

- This is a **modified egg drop problem** with a constraint that if an egg does not break, you **cannot pick it up again**. Let's analyze the best approach to solve this efficiently.

### üî• **Understanding the Problem:**
- You have **4 eggs** and **30 floors**.
- If an egg **does not break**, you **cannot reuse it**.
- If an egg **breaks**, you know that it would break on all higher floors.

**Goal:** Find the **lowest** floor from which an egg will break.

### ‚úÖ **Optimal Strategy:**
Since we **lose an egg permanently** if it does not break, we need to be careful with our approach.  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Worst-Case Strategy (Linear Search - O(30)):**
- Start from floor **1** and go upwards, dropping an egg on every floor.
- The first floor where an egg **breaks** is our answer.
- **Worst-case drops:** **30** (if the egg never breaks).

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Better Strategy (Binary Search-like - O(log N)):**
- Since we have **4 eggs**, we can use a strategy that minimizes our worst-case attempts.
- A **good approach is to use a "grouping" method** where we divide floors strategically.

##### **Approach:**
1. Start from **floor 5**, drop an egg.
2. If it breaks, search floors **1 to 4** linearly.
3. If it does not break, go to **floor 10** and drop the next egg.
4. Repeat in increments of **5** (i.e., 15, 20, 25, 30).
5. When an egg **breaks**, search the previous 4 floors **linearly**.

This method ensures that in the worst case, we perform **6 drops** instead of 30.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Mathematical Approach (Optimized Strategy - O(‚àöN)):**
- We can drop eggs from floors in increments of **triangular numbers**:  
  - First egg at **floor 1**  
  - Second egg at **floor 3** (**1+2**)  
  - Third egg at **floor 6** (**1+2+3**)  
  - Fourth egg at **floor 10** (**1+2+3+4**)  
  - Continue increasing...

This reduces the worst-case attempts **to around 7-8 drops** instead of 30.

---

### üî• **Final Answer:**
- Using **grouped increments (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)**, we **minimize the number of drops**.
- **Worst-case:** Around **6-7 drops**.

This approach is **efficient and interviewer-friendly**, showing an understanding of **binary search principles and optimization techniques**. üöÄ
