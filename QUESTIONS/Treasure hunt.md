No problem! Let’s go through it slowly and clearly step-by-step so that you understand exactly how this works.

### The Puzzle
- You have **10 bags of coins**.
- **9 bags contain real coins** that weigh **1 gram each**.
- **1 bag contains forged coins** that weigh **1.1 grams each**.
- You have **only one chance to use a digital scale** to find the forged bag — you need to figure out which bag has the heavier coins with just **one weighing**.

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Label the bags from 1 to 10**.  
   So, you have Bag 1, Bag 2, Bag 3, ..., Bag 10.

2. **Pick a different number of coins from each bag** in a special way:  
   - Take **1 coin** from Bag 1.  
   - Take **2 coins** from Bag 2.  
   - Take **3 coins** from Bag 3.  
   - …  
   - Take **10 coins** from Bag 10.

### What Happens with a Forged Bag
- One bag contains forged coins that each weigh **1.1 grams**.  
- Since you took a different number of coins from each bag, the **extra weight** will tell you **which bag** contains the forged coins.
